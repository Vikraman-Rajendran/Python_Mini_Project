<ol><h3>Some famous motivational speech quotes about success include: </h3>
<li>"Great moments are born from great opportunity, and that's what you have here tonight, boys. That's what you've earned here tonight. One game; if we played them 10 times, they might win nine. But not this game, not tonight. Tonight, we skate with them. Tonight, we stay with them, and we shut them down, because we can. Tonight, we are the greatest hockey team in the world." â€” Herb Brooks</li>
<li>"Regardless of the situation, regardless of the scoreboard, you're going to be successful because you've put in all the time, all the effort, all the hard work, and you know that it's going to pay off." â€” Apollo Hester.</li>
<li>"Don't ever let somebody tell you that you can't do something. Not even me, alright? You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period." â€” "The Pursuit of Happyness."
<li>"The infinite player isn't playing to be number one...They're playing to outlast the competition." â€” Simon Sinek.</li>
